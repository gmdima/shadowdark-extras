And are mockups of an upcoming Hexplorations Deck & Kit coming in 2025 from Inkwell Ideas which will include new art from Dyson.  https://www.backerkit.com/call_to_action/fe9ea83c-e7c5-4e7f-add8-51f96876af9f/landing?ref=hexdownload

Here is Dyson's license info from his Autumn Lands maps:

This map is made available to you under a free license for personal or commercial use thanks to the awesome supporters of my Patreon Campaign. Over 500 amazingly generous people have come together to fund the site and these maps, making them free for your use.

Because of the incredible generosity of my patrons, I’m able to make these maps free for commercial use also. Each month while funding is over the $300 mark, each map that achieves the $300+ funding level will be released under this free commercial license. You can use, reuse, remix and/or modify the maps that are being published under this commercial license on a royalty-free basis as long as they include attribution (“Cartography by Dyson Logos” or “Maps by Dyson Logos”).

Please note that the promotional version of this map (the one with the brown paper background) is not included in this commercial use license and the text & name are NOT released under this license, and cannot be used in conjunction with this map in a commercial project.
